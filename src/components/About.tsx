  Hello! I'm Lance Andrei R. Espina, a passionate and driven Frontend Developer based in Batangas, Philippines. 
  With a background in Computer Science and a strong curiosity for interactive and user-focused design, I specialize 
 building modern, responsive, and engaging web applications.
</p>
<p>
  My journey into web development was fueled by a love for technology and creativity â€” how code and design come 
together to create meaningful digital experiences. I've been sharpening my skills in React, TypeScript, Firebase, and 
UI/UX design, often exploring unique concepts like gamified interfaces and motion-based interactions.
</p>
<p>
  I strive to write clean, maintainable code and bring personality into every project I build. Outside of development, 
I enjoy exploring visual design trends, learning new frameworks, and occasionally competing in tech competitions that push 
my problem-solving skills further.
